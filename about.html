      Sean got his love for anime when he was a kid, because his father showed him an anime titled “Attack on Titan,” and he has continued to be fascinated by this form of media ever since. 
      This passion for anime also connects with his personal goal: to learn Japanese in reading, writing, and speaking. 
      His mother’s side of the family lives in Japan, and he views language not only as a personal challenge but also as a bridge to connect more closely with his heritage.
